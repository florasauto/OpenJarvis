# Floras Auto – OpenJarvis Team Notes

This fork tracks the upstream [OpenJarvis](https://github.com/open-jarvis/OpenJarvis)
project, a local-first personal AI agent framework from Stanford. These notes
cover what the team needs to get a working checkout, run the tests, and keep
our branch in good shape. The upstream `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` remain
the source of truth for the project itself.

Evaluation baseline: upstream `main` at commit `ef8d459`, verified 2026-11-02.

## Branch workflow

| Branch | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main` | Upstream plus these team notes. Receives merges from `floras-auto-dev` only. |
| `floras-auto-dev` | Our working line. Feature branches merge into this. |
| `feature/<short-name>` | One branch per task, opened as a PR into `floras-auto-dev`. |

To pull in upstream changes:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/open-jarvis/OpenJarvis.git
git fetch upstream main
git checkout main && git merge --ff-only upstream/main && git push origin main
git checkout floras-auto-dev && git merge main
```

## Requirements

| Component | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Python | 3.10 – 3.13 | 3.14 is excluded upstream because numpy has no wheel for it. |
| uv | latest | Manages the venv and dependencies. |
| Rust toolchain | stable | Needed to build the PyO3 extension. |
| Node.js | 22.22 or newer | Only for the browser GUI. |
| npm | 11.x | The frontend refuses npm 10. See the workaround below. |
| Ollama | latest | Default local inference engine. The CLI and server refuse to start without a reachable engine. |

## Setup from source

```bash
uv sync --extra dev --extra framework-comparison --extra server
```

```bash
uv run maturin develop --manifest-path rust/crates/openjarvis-python/Cargo.toml
```

```bash
uv run jarvis init --force --engine ollama --no-scan
```

These are the same extras CI installs. The plain `uv sync --extra dev` from the
upstream README is not enough to collect the test suite, because the server
tests import FastAPI.

If Ollama lives on another machine on the shop network, pass its address:

```bash
uv run jarvis init --force --engine ollama --host http://<host>:11434
```

### GUI (optional)

The frontend pins npm 11. On a machine with npm 10, run npm 11 through npx:

```bash
cd frontend && npx -y npm@11 ci && npx -y npm@11 run build
```

The build writes into `src/openjarvis/server/static/`, and `jarvis serve`
hosts the GUI from there. `jarvis gui` starts the Vite dev server instead.

On first launch the GUI shows a "Win a Mac mini" leaderboard and analytics
opt-in dialog. Choose **Continue without sharing** unless the team has decided
otherwise. Analytics are also off in the generated config
(`analytics.enabled = false`).

## Running the tests

Python, the same lane CI runs:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -n auto -q --tb=short -m "not live and not cloud and not hub"
```

Rust:

```bash
cd rust && cargo test --workspace
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend && npx -y npm@11 test
```

Lint and format:

```bash
uv run ruff check src/ tests/ && uv run ruff format --check src/ tests/
```

### Status at the baseline commit

| Suite | Result |
|---|---|
| Python | 9383 passed, 4 failed, 106 skipped |
| Rust | all passed, 29 crates |
| Frontend | 117 passed |
| Ruff | clean |

The four Python failures (`tests/server/test_connectors_router.py` and
`tests/tools/test_web_search.py`) make live network calls to Granola,
DuckDuckGo, and example.com. They pass with open internet access and fail
behind a restrictive proxy. Treat them as environment failures, not
regressions, unless the error text changes.

## Quick smoke test

With Ollama running and a model pulled:

```bash
uv run jarvis doctor
```

```bash
uv run jarvis ask "Hello"
```

```bash
uv run jarvis serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"qwen3.5:4b","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hello"}]}'
```

The server is OpenAI-compatible, exposes 97 routes, and supports streaming.
Stop it with `uv run jarvis stop`.

## Scheduled monitor: morning auction review

Our first configured agent. Every morning it reads the overnight notes the
team drops into a folder, lists each unit bought from Edge Pipeline, IAA, and
Salvato with its pickup or title status, flags follow-up calls, and stores a
dated summary so the next run can compare against it. It only reads locally
indexed documents, so nothing leaves the machine.

Files:

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `configs/floras-auto/scheduled-monitor.toml` | Config installed to `~/.openjarvis/config.toml`. |
| `scripts/floras-auto/setup-scheduled-monitor.sh` | One-shot setup: installs the config, indexes notes, registers the task. |

Set it up:

```bash
scripts/floras-auto/setup-scheduled-monitor.sh ~/FlorasAuto/overnight-notes "0 7 * * 1-6"
```

Then run it once to test, and start the scheduler to honour the schedule:

```bash
uv run jarvis scheduler run-task operative
```

```bash
uv run jarvis scheduler start
```

The scheduler runs in the foreground. On a shop machine, run it under a
service manager or a scheduled task so it survives reboots.

The upstream guide for this preset is out of date. The real command syntax is:

| Documented | Actual |
|---|---|
| `scheduler create --prompt X --schedule Y` | `scheduler create "X" --type cron --value "Y"` |
| `scheduler run <id>` | `scheduler run-task <agent-name>` |
| `scheduler status <id>` | `scheduler logs <id>` |
| `scheduler delete <id>` | `scheduler cancel <id>` |

Verified in the sandbox on 2026-11-02 with a stand-in engine: task creation,
an immediate run through the operative agent, and the run log all worked.
The model's actual reasoning still needs checking on a machine with Ollama.

## Known quirks

- `jarvis config show` reports `Tools: none` even when the config enables
  tools. The tools still register (`jarvis tool list` shows them). Display
  issue only, not yet investigated.
- The frontend build rewrites `frontend/tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`. Discard that
  change rather than committing it.
- `jarvis serve` and `jarvis ask` exit immediately with "No inference engine
  available" when nothing answers on the Ollama port. Start Ollama first.

## Candidate uses for the dealership

These are starting points for discussion, not commitments.

- **Scheduled monitor agent** to summarize overnight auction and purchase
  emails into a morning brief.
- **Deep research agent** over indexed internal documents such as parts
  catalogs and policy binders.
- **Code assistant agent** for internal scripts, with data staying on our own
  hardware rather than a cloud API.
